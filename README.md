# Train_Ticket_Booking
In this project, there are 80 seats in a train carriage, with only 7 seats in a row and only 3 seats in the last row.
This train has only one coach for the sake of simplicity. A single person can reserve up to seven seats at once.
When reserving seats, the priority is to book them in a single row.
If seats are not available in a single row, the booking should be made in such a way that close seats are reserved.
